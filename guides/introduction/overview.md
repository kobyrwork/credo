# Overview

Credo is a static code analysis tool for the Elixir language with a focus on teaching and code consistency.

`credo` can show you refactoring opportunities in your code, complex code fragments, warn you about common mistakes, show inconsistencies in your naming scheme and - if needed - help you enforce a desired coding style.

The basic functionality will be familiar to you if you used a linter like JavaScript's [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), Ruby's [RuboCop](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop) or C#'s [Stylecop](https://github.com/StyleCop/StyleCop) before.
